<h2>Purification of Cas9 protein</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<h3>Day 1: Cell transformation</h3>
<li>Add ~200 ng of plasmid DNA (pMJ806) to 50 μl of freshly thawed BL21 competent cells and incubate on ice for 15 min.</li>
<li>Heat-shock cells by incubation at 42 °C for 45 s, then place cells on ice for further 3 min.</li>
<li>Add 500 μl of LB medium to the cells and incubate the culture at 37 °C for 1 h in a shaking incubator.</li>
<li>Plate 100 μl of culture out on LB agar containing 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin.</li>
<li>Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.</li>
<h3>Day 2: Culture growth and induction</h3>
<li>Pick one colony from the agar plate and inoculate 50 ml LB medium containing 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin.</li>
<li>Incubate the preculture at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (250 rpm) overnight.</li>
<li>Use 10 ml of the preculture to inoculate 1 L prewarmed LB medium supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin in a 2.8L flask.</li>
<li>Incubate the cultures at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (90 rpm) while monitoring the cell growth by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD600).</li>
<li>Reduce the temperature to 18 °C at an OD of ~ 0.8 and continue shaking for additional 30 min.</li>
<li>Add 150 μl 1 M isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to each flask (200 μM final concentration) for induction of protein expression.</li>
<li>Continue shaking at 18 °C overnight for another 12-16 h.</li>
<h3>Day 3: Cas9 purification by using TALON Spin Columns</h3>
<li>Harvest cells by centrifugation for 15 min at 3500 rpm (~2700 x g) in a swingbucket rotor in 1 L bottles.</li>
<li>Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets using ~20 ml ice-chilled lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per cell pellet from 1 L culture. 
<li>Resuspended cell pellets can either be used directly for further purification or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for several months without loss of Cas9 enzymatic activity.
<li>Lyse the resuspended cell pellets using a ultrasonic homogenizer (Branson Digital Sonifier Model 102C). The lysate should be cooled on ice between passes.
<li>Clarify the lysate by centrifugation in 50 ml Nalgene Oak Ridge tubes at 18,000 rpm (~30,000 x g) in an SS-34 rotor (or equivalent) for 30 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant.

(Steps 18 and 19 should be performed at 4 °C. Equilibrate 0.5 ml of TALON-NX Resin (Takara) packed in a spin column with 2 ml lysis buffer. Load the cleared lysate on the column through centrifuge) 

<li>Wash the columns with 2 ml wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) for three times. Elute with 400 μl elution buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) three times and collect in 2 ml microtubes. 
<li>Dialyze the sample in dialysis tubing in 1 L dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPESKOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA) at 4 °C overnight. Dialysis buffer (without DTT and glycerol) can be prepared as a 10 x stock, but DTT should be added immediately prior to use. Measuring the Cas9 protein concentration by using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer.
<h2>Preparation of guide RNAs</h2>
<h3>Construction of transcription vectors</h3>
<ol>
<li>Synthesize a gBlock containing T7 promoter, guide RNA scaffold, and two BsaI cloning sites in between, was synthesized. 
<li>Insert the gBlock into pENTR4 between NcoI and XbaI through Gibson assembly replacing the ccdB cassette, resulting in pT7-sgRNA
<li>Synthesize two complementary oligonucleotides for the spacer sequence of sgRNAs, anneal them form a double stranded DNA fragment, and then cloned into BsaI sites in pT7-sgRNA.
</ol>
<h3>In vitro transcription and purification</h3>
<ol>
<li>Linearize pT7-sgRNA derived gRNA-specific construct using restriction enzyme site NcoI, 
<li>Dephosphorylate the digestion with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (rSAP) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 
<li>Purified with DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). 
<li>Thaw the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) components, mix and pulse-spin in microfuge to collect solutions to the bottoms of tubes. Keep on ice. 
<li>Set up the reaction at room temperature in the following order:
      <li>Reaction set up for short transcripts (< 0.3 kb):
      <li>Nuclease-free water         	x µl
      <li>NTP Buffer Mix					10 µl     (final NTP concentration 6.7 mM)
      <li>Template DNA            	   y µl (1 µg)
      <li>T7 RNA Polymerase Mix     	2 µl
      <li>Total				        	   30 µl
<li>Mix thoroughly and pulse-spin in a microfuge. Incubate at 37 °C for 16 hours.
<li>Add 30 µl nuclease-free water to each 20 µl reaction, followed by 2 µl of DNase I (RNase-free), mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37 °C. (This step is to remove template DNA)
<li>Purify the products with RNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research)
<li>Measure the concentration by using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. 
</ol>
<h2>PCR/RNP cleavage Assays</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mix 1μg of sgRNA and 1μg of Cas9 protein in 6 µl 1x Cas9 reaction buffer.
<li>Incubated at room temperature for 15 min to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. 
<li>Set up RNP reaction as follows.
   <li>RNP					      2 µl
   <li>PCR product (1 µg) 		x µul
   <li>Water					   y µl
   <li>Total					   10 µl

<li>Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 3 hours.
<li>Inactivate the reaction at 65 °C for 15 minutes. 
<li>Analyze the digestion immediately with electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel.</p>

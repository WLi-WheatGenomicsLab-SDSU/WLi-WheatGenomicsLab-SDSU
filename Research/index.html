<h4>The long-term goals of our research are:</h4>
<ol>
<li><h6>to develop germplasm with improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses</h6></li>
<li><h6>to generate genetic and genomic resources for taking forward wheat research</h6></li>
</ol>
<h6>The Li lab at SDState is focused on understanding genetics, genomics and evolution of wheat and its relatives and utilize the knowledge for germplasm enhancement:</h6>
<ul>
<li><a href="/grainsize_project"><I>CRISPR-based genome editing of grain size regulators for novel variation to increase wheat genetic yield potential.</I></a></li>
<li><a href="/swg/"><I>Dissecting the sea wheatgrass genome to transfer biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance into wheat.</I></a></li>
<li>Root Development and VSR.</li>
<li>Understanding cuticular wax biosynthesis in wheat and its role in drought tolerance.</li>
<li>Speciation of diploid and polyploid wheat and relative species and role of chromosome rearrangements.</li>
</ul>
